# Koala (Koaa)

Koala is a personal finance companion focused on helping users understand, plan, and improve their money habits while keeping sensitive data private and local. The app blends simple, practical money tools (transactions, budgets, goals, debts) with on-device intelligence that generates insights, detects anomalies, and suggests smarter budgeting behavior.

Who it's for
- People who want a compact, privacy-first finance app to track day-to-day spending and plan savings.
- Anyone who prefers local-first storage and on-device machine learning instead of cloud analytics.

What Koala helps you do
- Track income and expenses quickly with an easy transaction flow and category management.
- Create and monitor budgets and savings goals, and get notified when limits are close or exceeded.
- Manage debts and recurring payments, and automatically generate recurring transactions or job-based income entries.
- Receive personalized insights: spending patterns, anomalies, suggested budgets, and a financial "persona" profile.
- Safely export your data or reset the app when needed.

Privacy & security
- Sensitive data is encrypted on device using platform-backed secure storage.
- Optional biometric / PIN locking protects app access.
- Machine learning and analytics run locally; no user financial data needs to leave your device.

Background & notifications
- Built-in background worker checks budgets and reminders, and can surface helpful notifications (welcome nudges, weekly summaries, budget alerts).
